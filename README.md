# Heart_disease_prediction_kaggle

Using different classification models to predict the chances of heart_disease based on certain given number of parameters
#The dataset is imported from kaggle and is based on UCI machine learning repository.
#The attributes of dataset are:
1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
